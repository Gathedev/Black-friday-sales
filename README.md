# Black-friday-sales
In this project, we utilized the black friday sale data from last year to create a predictive model for forecasting this yearâ€™s sales. Initially, we performed data cleaning, analysis, and visualization to prepare the dataset. We then implemented multiple regression algorithms, named, Linear Regression, Decision tree Regression, Random Forest Regression, and KNN Regression, to determine the best-fit model for accurate sales prediction.
